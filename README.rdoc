== Buglog

Buglog is my project where I learn Angular and try to uncover what types of bugs exist out there. The app can be found here:
https://buglog.herokuapp.com/

Concept, design and implementation by yours truly :)

Buglog is built on the following technologies:

* Angular

* Rails

* SCSS

* Bootstrap

Please submit an issue if you find one. Can also be a request for a feature. All feedback welcome to buglogapp@gmail.com.
